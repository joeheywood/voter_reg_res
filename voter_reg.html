# Background and objectives

---

# Context

- Ongoing work at the Greater London Authority to improve voter registration
- Includes a drive later on this year to increase voter registration


![alt text](https://www.yourvotematters.co.uk/__data/assets/git_bridge/0007/219580/dist/mysource_files/logo.svg "Your vote matters")
--

- Trying to back up this campaign with evidence - literature review
- Regression analysis at ward level

--

- Idea that we can use the data we tend to use for population projections, census analysis, social policy to do something a bit different
 
---

# Objectives

1. Use machine learning techniques to spot patterns and trends within the data 
1. Gain some insights that more traditional methods would miss 
1. Try out some new techniques

--

1. Focus on **understanding** the data. 
1. Produce recommendations and ideas about how to pursue better-informed campaigns to maximize voter registration in the capital

# Data

---

# Participating boroughs

- Lewisham

--

- Brent
- Waltham Forest
- Wandsworth

--

- Greenwich
- Lambeth



---


# Importance of data

- Producing and maintaining the data set is the most time-consuming part of this project
- Probably be the most valuable output from the project

--

- Never going to be perfect

--

- Starting point was an anonymised electoral register in Lewisham
- Only one point in time, no names, but a UPRN for each address

---

# Other data sources

.pull-left[
- Census / ONS population estimates
- UK buildings: data about the age and type of buildings
- CDRC data: population churn
]
.pull-right[
- EPC
- Land registry data
- Other bits and pieces
]

Always on the lookout for data that will show evidence of a younger, renting, precarious households/population

# Methodology

---

# Methods

### Unsupervised

- K-means clustering

### Supervised

- Multiple regression
- Regression tree
- Random forest

---

# Software

Everything I have done has been using the R programming language. This includes:

- Wrangling data
- Each of the methods
- Visualising data (ggplot, plotly)
- Mapping the data (leaflet)

--

### Rmarkdown

- Communicating findings (flexdashboard, crosstalk)
- This presenttation

---

# Communicating findings

I have set up a small website on github, using the output from `flexdashboard`. This means I write everything using R/Rmarkdown.

- Interactivity provided by `crosstalk`
- Big advantage of this is I can have a shiny-*ish* app, but the (sensitive) data behind it doesn't have to be on the site

---

# Results

--

### ... (so far)

--



---

# Clustering

Focused on buildings in Lewisham to begin with. Five groups emerged.

- Victorian terraced housing, often converted into flats 
- High proportions of flat blocks built in the post-war (1945-79)
- Terraced houses built between the wars
- Modern flat blocks 
- Areas with more detached/semi-detached houses, mostly interwar


---

### Predictive modelling

What I am using so far:

- Private rented
- IMD
- Living in flats
- People with degrees
- Average age of adults
- Proportion of population that is under 18
- Buildings 1979-1999
- Buildings 2000-
